# What is this

A small joke-clone of Sokkoban with a bomberman twist.
It was made as an excuse to play around with Javascript for the first time, and try out the p5 processing library.
It is purely a playing around project and I do not own any of the images used, nor do I intend to sell it in any way.

# What does it do

Fire up the Sokko-Palhas file and hopefully it will open your browser to be ready to play.

I've heard that it doesn't work on Google Chrome but it does on Firefox, so watch out for that.

Also, sometimes it opens up way too zoomed in for some reason, keep in mind that zooming out is always an option.
